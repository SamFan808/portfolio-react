                  Sam was born on the island of O'ahu in the State of Hawaii. He
                  was raised by native geese, known in Hawaiian as the Nene.
                  Though the Hawaiian goose resembles the Canadian Goose, the
                  Hawaiian goose does not prefer pineapple on their pizzas.
                  Despite having been raised by geese, Sam does not currently
                  show any traits or habits typical of Hawaiian geese. However,
                  they would not refuse the addition of Canadian Bacon. Sam left
                  the sunny shores of Hawaii for the snowy slopes of Colorado.
                  He attended college for several years, and attained both
                  undergraduate and graduate degrees. He is for the most part a
                  fully functional human adult. He currently resides in Denver,
                  Colorado and frequently sees several of the local Canadian
                  Geese, and often will wave to them, bringing back fond
                  memories of his childhood.
